Elevated to the core **CENPOS** initiative, the overarching ecosystem governing the entire residential management infrastructure for the Xunta de Galicia—spanning clinical administration, pharmaceutical inventory, and complex billing systems. This pivot marked a significant expansion in scope, bridging advanced technical execution with strategic **Analyst-Programmer** responsibilities.

Driving technological modernization, I assumed the mantle of **Technical Lead** for the CENRES squad. My stewardship encompasses the full operational lifecycle: from architectural task estimation and validation to orchestrating daily stand-ups and mentoring of both intern and junior profiles.

Furthermore, I manage critical **CI/CD pipelines**, executing production deployments for both CENPOS and CENRES, ensuring high-availability and fault tolerance for essential public services.
