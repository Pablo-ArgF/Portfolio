This project involved the end-to-end engineering of a custom programming language compiler, serving as a deep dive into **Language Theory** and **Compiler Design**. Leveraging [**ANTLR**](https://github.com/antlr/antlr4) for robust lexical and syntactic analysis, I constructed a comprehensive parsing pipeline capable of transforming raw source code into structured representations.

The core of the system is built around a strongly-typed **Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)**, designed to encapsulate the hierarchy and logic of the language. The semantic analysis phase was implemented using the **Visitor Pattern**, enabling a decoupled and extensible architecture for:
*   **Type Checking**: Rigorous verification of variable types and function signatures.
*   **Scope Management**: Handling variable visibility and intricate scoping rules.
*   **Error Handling**: A sophisticated error recovery system providing precise feedback on syntax and semantic violations.

This undertaking demonstrates foundational expertise in computer science, moving beyond application development to understand the very tools that power software engineering.
