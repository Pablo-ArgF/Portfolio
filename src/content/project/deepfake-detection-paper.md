This research initiative represents the academic evolution of the **[Deepfake Detection Final Degree Project](/projects/deepfake-detection)**, shifting focus from pure detection accuracy to **interpretability and transparency** in AI systems. The primary objective is to contribute to the scientific community by producing a detailed paper on **Explainable AI (XAI)** applied to forensic video analysis.

Building upon the original hybrid CNN-RNN architecture, I implemented advanced interpretability mechanisms to visualize the model's decision-making process:

*   **Grad-CAM (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping)**: Integrated to generate visual explanations, highlighting the exact regions of a frame (e.g., unnatural artifacts in facial features) that triggered the deepfake classification.
*   **Frame Variation Heatmaps**: Developed novel visualization techniques to track pixel-level anomalies across temporal sequences, exposing subtle manipulations invisible to the naked eye.
*   **Enhanced UI/UX**: Overhauled the user interface to present these complex visual metrics intuitively, bridging the gap between high-level model inference and human-understandable evidence.

This work not only refines the technical prowess of the detection engine but also addresses ethical AI concerns by providing verifiable proofs for every classification.
