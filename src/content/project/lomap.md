Engineered a privacy-first geospatial platform that fundamentally decouples user data from application logic using the **Solid Protocol**. This architecture ensures that all personal location data, reviews, and social interactions are stored in user-controlled **Decentralized Web Nodes (Pods)**, guaranteeing absolute data sovereignty and compliance with the highest privacy standards.

Developed within a high-performance squad of four engineers adhering to **Agile methodologies**, the project emphasized rapid iteration and rigorous quality assurance. The technical backbone features a type-safe **React** and **TypeScript** frontend, seamlessly integrated with **Solid's pods**.

Key technical achievements include:
- **Decentralized Architecture**: Implementation of Solid specifications to allow users to store POIs and media in personal Pods (e.g., Inrupt), interoperable with any Solid-compliant application.
- **Robust DevOps Pipeline**: Established a comprehensive CI/CD workflow using **GitHub Actions**, achieving strict quality gates via **SonarCloud** for code analysis and coverage.
- **Containerization**: Full Docker support for consistent deployment across environments.
- **Social Graph Integration**: Enables decentralized friend networks and location sharing without a central authority holding the social graph.
