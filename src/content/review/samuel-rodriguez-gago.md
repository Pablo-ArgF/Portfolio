I could continue rehashing the same topic about Pablo’s technical capabilities and go over his proficiency again, but instead I’ll focus on his soft skills. Pablo bonded deeply with the team, emerging as a natural technical leader. He guided the team toward new horizons and supported his colleagues as both an anchor for keeping the team grounded and aligned with realistic goals and a helping hand. He consistently contributed to the continuous improvement of both the project and the team, going beyond his role day by day.
I’m really glad I had the chance to work with him and learn from his way of thinking.
